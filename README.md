Hi! ٩(⊙‿⊙)۶

Obopenai is an add-on developed by Outbrain™️ to address some requirements that were not satisfied by the existing add-ons in Splunkbase.

The main differences are:
1. Commands are written in V2 protocol.
2. Streaming command allows for querying on multiple events.
3. 'Modes' allow you to utilize system roles (works best with model=gpt-4).
4. Conversation mode.
5. Compatible with Add-On Builder.
6. And more.

Notice:
- This is a public version of the app, so things might work differently for you. If you have any requests or run into any problems, or if you want to contribute, feel free to do so on GitHub.
- AI is not a magic solution and may produce inaccurate information.
- A separate OpenAI license may be obtained from OpenAI.

We hope you find this add-on useful.
