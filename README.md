# TA-ob-openai-chatgpt
A Splunk add-on for OpenAI integration.

***Please download the app from Splunkbase.\
The `builder` branch is the add-on builder version, and has the latest bugfixes. Ignore other branches for now.\
Splunk Cloud users: This app is not qualified for cloud because it allows user to specify their own http url. for 100 Shekels and 15 minutes I will fix it and make the app available for cloud also.***

Hi! ٩(⊙‿⊙)۶

Obopenai is an add-on developed by Outbrain™️ to address some requirements that were not satisfied by the existing add-ons in Splunkbase.

The main differences are:
1. Commands are written in V2 protocol.
2. Streaming command allows for querying on multiple events.
3. 'Modes' allow you to utilize system roles (works best with model=gpt-4).
4. Conversation mode.
5. Compatible with Add-On Builder.
6. And more.

Notice:
- This is a public version of the app, so things might work differently for you. If you have any requests or run into any problems, or if you want to contribute, feel free to do so on GitHub.
- AI is not a magic solution and may produce inaccurate information.
- A separate OpenAI license may be obtained from OpenAI.

We hope you find this add-on useful.
