Main differences are:
1. Command is written in V2 protocol.
2. 'Modes' allow you to save system roles for easy use (works best with model=gpt-4).
3. Conversation mode.
4. Compatible with Add-On Builder
5. And more

Notice: this is a public version of the app so things might work differently for you.
